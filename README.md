# whac-a-mole-ukelele

Project where I'll be using the Arduino UNO and connect it to a whac-a-mole game in Unity3D.<br>
The controller of the game will be an ukelele(small version of a guitar). <br>
The Arduino UNO will detect the notes(frequencies) of the ukelele and the notes will be used as the input of the game.<br>
Every mole will come out of the hole and if the player plays the right note on the instrument, the mole will be hit and the player gets points.<br>
If the player plays the wrong note, the player will lose one life.<br>
When the player has zero lives left, the game ends.
