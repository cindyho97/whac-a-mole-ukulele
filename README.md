# whac-a-mole-ukelele

Project where I'll be using the Arduino UNO and connect it to a whac-a-mole game in Unity3D.
The controller of the game will be an ukelele. 
The Arduino UNO will detect the frequencies(notes) of the ukelele and used as the input of the game.
Every mole will come out of the hole and if the player plays the right note on the instrument, the mole will be hit and the player gets points.
If the player plays the wrong note, the player will lose one life.
When the player has zero lives left, the game ends.
